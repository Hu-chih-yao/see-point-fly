# Output Directory

This directory contains output files generated by the drone project's tools and diagnostic utilities.

## Directory Structure

```

## Screenshots Directory

The `screenshots/` directory contains images generated by various diagnostic tools:

- **Monitor screenshots**: Images captured from different monitors for resolution analysis
  - `captured_monitor_0.jpg` - Virtual screen (all monitors combined)
  - `captured_monitor_1.jpg` - Primary monitor
  - `monitor_1_screenshot.jpg` - Primary monitor with analysis overlay
  - `monitor_2_screenshot.jpg` - Secondary monitor (if present)

- **Pipeline test images**: Images generated during pipeline validation
  - `test_captured.jpg` - Raw frame from screen capture
  - `test_encoded_decoded.jpg` - Frame after encoding/decoding (API simulation)
  - `test_projection.jpg` - Frame with projection test points overlaid

- **Coordinate system visualizations**:
  - `coordinate_system_debug.jpg` - Visualization of the coordinate system
  - `resolution_check_debug.jpg` - Debug image from resolution check

- **Capture comparison**:
  - `capture_raw.jpg` - Unmodified screen capture
  - `capture_fixed.jpg` - Screen capture with HiDPI/scaling adjustment

## Usage Notes

1. These output files are primarily for diagnostic purposes and are not required for normal operation.

2. When troubleshooting issues, compare these images to verify:
   - Correct monitor resolution detection
   - Proper image encoding/decoding
   - Accurate coordinate projection
   - Visualization alignment

3. Most tools will automatically generate new images when run, overwriting existing files.

4. For detailed interpretation of these files, refer to the documentation in the `documents/` directory.
