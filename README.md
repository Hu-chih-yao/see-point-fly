# OpenAI compatible API
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
```

### Tello Mode Configuration

Configure your navigation mode in `config_tello.yaml`:

```yaml
# Choose between "gemini" or "openai" (OpenAI compatible API)
api_provider: "gemini"

# Model Selection (optional - leave empty for our experiment defaults)
model_name: ""  # e.g., "gemini-2.0-flash", "gemini-2.5-pro", "openai/gpt-4.1"

# Choose your operational mode
operational_mode: "adaptive_mode"  # or "obstacle_mode"

# Processing configuration
command_loop_delay: 2  # seconds between processing cycles
```

#### Tello Mode Selection Guide

- "move toward the window on the left"

#### 🛡️ **Obstacle Mode** (Safe Navigation)
Best for complex environments with obstacles:

```yaml
# config_tello.yaml
operational_mode: "obstacle_mode"
command_loop_delay: 2
```

```bash
# Safe obstacle-aware flight
spf tello

# With enhanced recording
spf tello --record --record-session "outdoor_flight"
```

**Example Commands:**

# Debug mode (live camera feed + detailed logging)
spf tello --debug

# Skip camera check (if camera issues)
spf tello --skip-camera-check

# Record flight with custom session name
spf tello --record --record-session "my_flight"
```

## Simulator Mode Usage

### 🎮 **Simulator Mode** (Virtual Environment)

- `A/D`: Turn left/right
- `←/→` (Arrow keys): Roll left/right
- `W/S`: Up/Down
- `T`: Takeoff
- `L`: Land
- `E`: Emergency stop (stops all movement)

AI control will automatically resume when you release all keys.

### Simulator Mode Controls
Simulator mode sends keyboard commands to your simulator/game environment. The specific controls depend on your simulator's keyboard mapping.

## Troubleshooting

### Tello Mode Selection Issues

**Problem**: Not sure which Tello operational mode to use?
```yaml
# For indoor precision tasks
operational_mode: "adaptive_mode"

# For outdoor/complex environments
operational_mode: "obstacle_mode"
```

## Tello Mode Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
- ✅ Ensure computer is connected to Tello's Wi-Fi network
- ✅ Tello battery should be >50% charged
- ✅ Keep Tello within 10 meters Wi-Fi range
- ✅ Restart Tello if connection fails

### Operational Mode Issues

#### Adaptive Mode Troubleshooting
- **Slow Processing**: Normal for precision mode (2-5 seconds per command)
- **Depth Estimation**: Ensure good lighting and clear target objects
- **Movement Precision**: Works best in structured indoor environments

#### Obstacle Mode Troubleshooting
- **Longer Processing**: Normal for enhanced mode (3-8 seconds per command)
- **Timeout Errors**: System includes 120-second timeout protection
- **Keepalive Messages**: Normal intensive keepalive logging during API calls
- **High Recording**: 10fps recording uses more storage space

### Performance Issues
- **API Timeouts**: Switch to `adaptive_mode` for faster processing
- **Memory Usage**: Obstacle mode uses ~100MB more RAM
- **Storage Space**: Obstacle mode records 3x more frames

### Safety Features
- **Automatic Landing**: System lands drone after 3-5 consecutive errors
- **Manual Override**: Use keyboard controls for immediate safety control
- **Battery Monitoring**: Obstacle mode includes comprehensive battery warnings

## Simulator Mode Troubleshooting

### Screen Capture Problems
- **Black Screen**: Ensure the simulator window is visible and not minimized
- **Wrong Monitor**: Use `--monitor 2` to specify correct display
- **Resolution Mismatch**: System auto-detects resolution, but may need window adjustment

### Virtual Navigation Issues
- **Poor Detection**: Ensure good contrast and clear visual elements in simulator
- **Slow Response**: Normal processing time is 3-8 seconds per command
- **Keyboard Not Working**: Check that simulator window has focus after giving commands

### Setup Issues
- **Monitor Info**: Use `spf sim --info` to see available monitors
- **Debug Mode**: Use `--debug` to visualize coordinate system and verify setup
